# Yelp Dataset Challenge: Authorship Attribution and Keras Tutorials

This repository and related resources forms our submission to the 2017 Yelp Dataset Challenge. 

With new advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, there has been a surge of talk about *Democratizing* AI. (For example, see [https://news.microsoft.com/features/democratizing-ai/](https://news.microsoft.com/features/democratizing-ai/)). As part of this process, we believe that new research should be as accessible as possible, to as many people as possible. Therefore, instead of presenting our work in a single format, targetted at a specific audience, we instead present it in many formats, with different target audiences.

* For the academic, we present a research paper in which we detail our experiments on different methods for authorship attribution tasks.
* For those just starting out in their machine learning journey, we present runnable code and clear explanations in a Jupyter Notebook, showing how classification tasks work, and explaining each step.
* For the not-quite-beginner, we present an in-depth, practical tutorial, showing how to easily create neural models using Keras and run these on powerful cloud GPU machines through AWS.
