# Yelp Dataset Challenge: Authorship Attribution and Keras Tutorials

This repository and related resources forms our submission to the 2017 Yelp Dataset Challenge. 

With new advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, there has been a surge of talk about *Democratizing* AI. (For example, see [https://news.microsoft.com/features/democratizing-ai/](https://news.microsoft.com/features/democratizing-ai/)). It is important that everyone benefits from advances in this area, and not only huge corporations.

As part of this process, we believe that new research should be as accessible as possible, to as many people as possible. Therefore, instead of presenting our work in a single format, targetted at a specific audience, we instead present it in many formats, with different target audiences, including academics, beginners, and programmers. 

Most of our research is related to authorship attribution. That is, we attempt to identify authors based on their writing style. This is an interesting task with many practical applications (for example, detecting fake reviews, or deanonymising criminals online). Moreover, many of the methods we use are generalizable to other text classification tasks, and, more broadly, to most machine learning tasks. We hope that our research can be used not only to advance our own field, but also to help others learn more about related specialisations that may be of more interest to them.

Our submission consists therefore of the following:

* For the academic community, we present a research paper in which we detail our experiments on different methods for authorship attribution tasks. We relate our experiments on the Yelp dataset to previous work done on Authorship Attribution, and provide the first results on new datasets that we created as subsets from Yelp reviews. We hope that others will use this data to compare future Authorship Attribution systems to ours.

* For those just starting out in their machine learning journey, we present runnable code and clear explanations in a Jupyter Notebook, showing how classification tasks work, and explaining each step. 
* For the not-quite-beginner, we present an in-depth, practical tutorial, showing how to easily create neural models using Keras and run these on powerful cloud GPU machines through AWS.
